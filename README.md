How It Works
Depe
ndency management: Checks if the node_modules directories exist before running npm install. This prevents redundant installs on subsequent runs.

Backend server: Runs server.js located in the backend directory, serving API endpoints for data processing.

Electron app: Uses the locally installed Electron binary to launch the desktop UI.

Troubleshooting
App stuck during startup or dependency install:

Ensure stable internet connection during the first run.

Run the batch script as Administrator to avoid permission issues.

Avoid spaces or special characters in the project path.

Manually run npm install in the root and backend folders to verify installations.

'Electron' or other commands not recognized:

Check if dependencies installed successfully in node_modules/.bin.

Delete node_modules and run the batch script again.

Windows path errors (due to spaces in folder names):
The batch script tries to handle paths with spaces by quoting them.
If errors persist, consider moving the project folder to a path without spaces (e.g., C:\RealScraper).

Performance Tips
Dependency installation speed depends mostly on your network and disk speed.

Use a wired connection for faster npm package downloads.

Keep Node.js and npm updated for best performance.

Consider using npm ci for clean installs on fresh clones.
